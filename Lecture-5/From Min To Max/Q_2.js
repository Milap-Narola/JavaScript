/*Q.2 you have to take two numbers, stored in variables with the following names
max, min
You have to print all the numbers from min to max, excluding max. Print each number on a new line
For example, if the value stored in max = 19, and the value stored in min = 14, then the output will be,
14,15,16,17,18.
Note: The value stored in max will always be greater than or equal to min
sample input 
max=10,min =6
output: 6,7,8,9. */
const Range = () => {

    let min = parseInt(document.getElementById("minInput").value);
    let max = parseInt(document.getElementById("maxInput").value);

    for (let i = min; i < max; i++) {
        console.log(i);
    }
